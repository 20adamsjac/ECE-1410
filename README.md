This repository contains the submitions I gave for my ECE 1410 class which was a transitionary class from C to C++. This class layed the foundation for higher level concepts by briefly covering sorting algorithms, classes, and other structures. The primary focus of this course was to take the students from  people who could generate passable code to programmers who were better equiped with skills to write code.
